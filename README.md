Final Year Module Selection Tool Project CTEC2906 - Object Oriented Development

-------------------
-- Marked results --
User Interface (UI): 24.00% -> A user interface exists for all three of the undeveloped forms, but does not provide a means of presenting or capturing all of the specified information, i.e. there are minor omissions.

Resizing behaviour: 4.00% -> At least one area of the application resizes horizontally OR vertically.

Event Handling: 16.00% -> Most event handlers work appropriately with minor areas for improvement

Fitness for purpose (does it function well?) -> 8.00% -> The application validates the majority of the application (e.g.  exceeding or submitting before 120 credits, removing mandatory modules, overwriting an existing profile, input fields, etc. With minor areas for improvement. More specific feedback includes "The reserved module cannot be removed, clicking on the remove button shows a null value in the modules list."

MVC Design & View Decomposition -> 12.00% -> As for 40%+ data - this data is passed cleanly between each MVC layer, and the view has a suitable public interface, e.g. methods should not return references to UI controls as this is poor for encapsulation. Furthermore, fields in the view should be private. There has been some attention paid to abstraction to reduce duplicate functionality.

Saving & Loading Student Data -> 0.00% -> No attempt at saving/loading data or attempted with many issues. More specific feedback includes "The loading student data event handler is included but without actual implementation."

-------------------

Total Grade: 64%

Improvements could be made here.
